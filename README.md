# Rock-Paper-Scissoris-Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors This page is an interactive version of the game Rock Paper Scissors, the user can decide at which score the game ends and then play against an AI (random). The code was inspired from different resorces from across the web. It was not necessary to commit often considering that I included the pseudocode in the java script.
